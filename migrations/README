This folder contains Alembic migration scripts. Use the following commands to create and apply migrations:

1. Create migration scripts:
   flask db init    # only once (already scaffolded)
   flask db migrate -m "message"
2. Apply migrations:
   flask db upgrade

Make sure Flask-Migrate is installed and your virtualenv is active. The project uses app factory `create_app()`.
